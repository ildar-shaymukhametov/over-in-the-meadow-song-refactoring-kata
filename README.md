1) randomize verses
2) children must conform to verse number. E.g., if original song's second verse becomes
first when randomized, it's fourth line must read 'And her little fish one'
3) randomize animals for verses, e.g. original song first verse's fish may become toadie or rattie. Mother and children should be of the same type.
4) randomize animals and verses at the same time
